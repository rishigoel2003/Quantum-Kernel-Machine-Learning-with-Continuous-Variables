# Quantum Kernel Machine Learning with Continuous Variables
Simulation Details for "Quantum Kernel Machine Learning with Continuous Variables" by Laura Henderson, Rishi Goel and Sally Shrapnel.

We present 4 simulation experiments on 3 datasets with the fock state displacement kernel, the experiments are labelled numerically as they appear in the paper. To run you need to install the required packages stated at the top of each python file and simply run, the resulting plots appear in a new folder labeled by what experiment number you run. The chosen seeds are for the specific dataset we present and hence will reproduce exact results presented in the paper.
